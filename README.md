## Project Overview

This website was developed as a semester-long IICT project to collaboratively design a frontend-only community portal using HTML and CSS. It features Home, Community News, Events, Directory, Resources, and Contact pages, all styled with clean layouts and subtle CSS animations. Through this work, we gained practical experience in semantic HTML, responsive design, and animation techniquesâ€”significantly improving our frontend development and design skills.
